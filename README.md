This project attempts to integrate iOS in-app purchases to a bevy app.

## Useful references
- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase
- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/purchaseaction
  - `PurchaseAction` or `purchase(options)` ? aka "swiftUI or UIKit" :thinking:

## Analysis

I'll be listing different approaches ranked from best to "less good" according to my opinion:

### 1
Best case scenario is that icrate supports StoreKit, as it's ticked on https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/issues/393/.

It's the best case scenario because icrate would offer a community hub to collaborate on this project.

Unfortunately, StoreKit integration in icrate appears to not work on iOS, and fixing that needs thorough refactoring: https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/issues/482.

### 2

Following advice of https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/issues/482 : we could fork icrate and fix the problem in a "dirty" way.

This approach is fine for a project but not too great for a library. Also, it's still quite complicated from what I tried (icrate locally wasn't compilingm not sure why... )

### 3

leverage objc to call directly storekit API ; doable, but requires good knowledge in rust/objc ffi.

### 4

leverage objc but call a simpler custom objc API: the simplest choice, but requires a bit of manual work, as well as multiple languages used.

Honestly, even though I listed it last, I like its simplicity.

## Current state

Solution 4 (objc + custom objc bridge to storekit) is what I'm implementing, currently not too far but a very basic POC is promising.

currently running as `RUST_LOG=info make run 2>&1 | grep -v 'WARN'` to limit WARN spam, there definitely is better ways, tell me about them!

I expect the SKProduct bridge to be a bit problematic though, I guess we'll need:

- Their identifiers
- a new function to retrieve their pricing.

The most naive option is to use an opaque pointer for SKProduct, and expose functions needed only: just to avoid the complexity of mapping the memory layout and avoid falling into the "map everything perfectly"rabbit hole ðŸ¤”.
